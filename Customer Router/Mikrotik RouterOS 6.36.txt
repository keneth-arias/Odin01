VPN Connection Configuration
==============================================================================

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.

! Your VPN Connection ID             : vpn-09d8d80c00c860bf8
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID    : vgw-08381058d0985feb1
! Your Customer Gateway ID           : cgw-0a9d0fc3023df0477

! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be configured on your Customer Gateway, but only one of those tunnels should be up at any given time.
! Note that Mikrotik RouterOs does not support Active/Active or Active/Standby setup with AWS hosted VPN solution.

! At this time this configuration has only been tested for RouterOS 6.36, but may work with other versions.

! This configuration uses the Winbox utility to configure the IPsec VPN connection. Winbox is a small utility that allows administration of Mikrotik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI.
! You can download this utility from: https://mikrotik.com/download

! #1: IPSec Proposal Configuration
!
! An IPsec proposal defines the IPsec parameters for encryption, authentication, Diffie-Hellman, and lifetime.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256,  or other DH
! groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

! #2: Internet Key Exchange
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime,
! and key parameters. The IKE peer is configured with the supported IKE encryption,  authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key
! parameters.Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256,  or other DH
! groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT). To
! ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must use the corresponding IP as the "Local Address".

! Create an IKE policy permitting traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet.

! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway. If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.

      b. Interface: Select the WAN/Outside interface
      c. Select Apply and Ok

! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4 Static Route Configuration
!
! Your Customer Gateway needs to set a static route for the prefix corresponding to your
! VPC to send traffic over the tunnel interface.
! An example for a VPC with a subnet/mask of 10.0.0.0/16 is provided below:

Go to IP Tab --> Routes

      a. Click on "+" button and select the General Tab
      b. Dst. Address: 10.0.0.0/16

! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #5: NAT Exemption
!
! If you are performing NAT on your Customer Gateway, you may have to add a nat exemption rule to permit traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet and vice versa.
! This example rule permits all traffic from the local subnet to the VPC subnet.

Go to IP Tab --> Firewall --> NAT

1) Click on "+" button and select the General Tab
      a. Chain: srcnat
      b. Src. Address: local subnet/mask
      c. Dst. Address: AWS VPC subnet/mask

2) Click on Action Tab
      a. Action = accept
      b. Select Apply and Ok

! Similarly, create a firewall rule permitting traffic from the Inside IP associated with your Customer Gateway to the  IP associated with the Virtual Private Gateway.

3) Click on "+" button and select the General Tab
      a. Chain: srcnat
      b. Src. Address: 169.254.33.90
      c. Dst. Address: 169.254.33.89

4) Click on Action Tab
      a. Action = accept
      b. Select Apply and Ok

! Note that there may be multiple firewall rules configured on your Customer Gateway. These rules may be conflicting with the nat exemption rule.
! It is recommended to position the nat exemption rules such that they are evaluated in an order before any other conflicting policy.
